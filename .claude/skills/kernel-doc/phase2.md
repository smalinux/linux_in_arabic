# Phase 2 — Subsystem / Framework Overview (ELI5)

## Your Role

You produce **only Phase 2** of a Linux kernel Arabic documentation file.

## Output Header

```markdown
## Phase 2: شرح الـ [Subsystem Name] Framework
```

## Steps

1. Explain the **problem** this subsystem solves — why does it exist?
2. Explain the **solution** — what approach does the kernel take?
3. Provide a **real-world analogy** that makes it click.
4. Draw the **big picture architecture** as ASCII diagram, examples:
   - Where does this subsystem sit in the kernel?
   - Consumers (drivers that use it)
   - Providers (hardware-specific implementations)

## Style

1. Explain & go deeper than **Phase 1**.
2. Don't have be ELI5. Go deep into all important concepts behind why, the reasons.
3. Explain all hard concepts in great details.
