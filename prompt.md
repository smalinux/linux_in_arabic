You are prompt engineer expert, I want to write claude code skills for translating & documenting Linux source code in arabic in md file. but keep concepts in English

I will give you linux kernel file/s and you will do these exact steps:

Phase 1. create new [File].ch.md, write all steps in one md file append to it, if I give you driver/clk/clk.c for example, you should write in driver/clk/clk.c.md

Phase 2. explain this subsystem or the framework related to this file. explain to me as I'm 5 but at the same time be concise and comprehensive

Phase 3. go deeper and explain deep details and md markdown draw graphs to make sense how each struct fit together, and draw whenever needed.

Phase 4. write comprehensive cheat sheet how to debug this in Linux kernel and hardware level

Phase 5. go over each group of these functions and explain them.

Phase 6. write practical senraios & stories when I will need this in really life, give 5 real life examples.

Phase 7. at the end write a list of URLs or most important LWN articles and any likes for searching more

I want each phase to be very detailed and as long as it needed, no limit with claude context

linux kernel files always will be under @./external/linux
